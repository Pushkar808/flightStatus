# Flight Notification System - Frontend

This is the frontend of the Flight Notification System, built with React.js. The frontend is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing flight information and receiving real-time notifications about changes in flight status, schedule, or gate of arrival or departure. The frontend connects to the backend service, which handles the flight data and notifications.

## Features
- **Real-time Notifications**: Users receive real-time notifications about changes in their flight details, such as schedule updates, status changes, or gate information.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and works well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- **Reusable Components**: The project uses a component-based architecture, making it easy to reuse and maintain UI elements.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Socket.IO-Client**: For real-time communication with the backend via WebSockets.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
